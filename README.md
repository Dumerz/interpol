# [Interpol](https://www.github.com/dumerz/Interpol)
Integer Program Oriented Language developed using Python 2.7

## Introduction
Interpol  which stands for Integer Program Oriented Language is a simple integer oriented programming language that deals with integers and consequently, no floating-point values. This implies that the result of arithmetic operations are automatically converted into integers. String are also allowed for printing purposes.
